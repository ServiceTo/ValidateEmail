# ValidateEmail
Library to validate an email address against its mail servers by doing a name server lookup and then connecting to its MX records.

## Tired of those pesky fake email addresses in your submission forms?
Add this little bit of majesty to your form validation rules and your server will connect to the MX records and test the validity of the address the user has entered.

It typically only takes a moment to validate a working address and when an invalid address is entered it takes longer, which can be a win, slowing down annoying script kiddies.
